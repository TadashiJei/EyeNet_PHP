/**
 * Provides a simple gettext replacement that works independently from
 * the system's gettext abilities.
 * It can read MO files and use them for translating strings.
 * The files are passed to gettext_reader as a Stream (see streams.php)
 *
 * This version has the ability to cache all strings and translations to
 * speed up the string lookup.
 * While the cache is enabled by default, it can be switched off with the
 * second parameter in the constructor (e.g. whenusing very large MO files
 * that you don't want to keep in memory)
